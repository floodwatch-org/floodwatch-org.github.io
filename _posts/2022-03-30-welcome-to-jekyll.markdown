title: "Welcome to Floodwatch"
---

The aim of this project is to provide a secured, distributed data infrastructure allowing data owners to share data effortlessly and securely, while concurrently allowing data users to access data on-demand. The data infrastructure is to underpin disaster response and decision support applications. The new focus on flood forecasting and alert is recommended by our collaborator in Vietnam. There is strong interest for this service since urban flooding is a regular challenge in HCMC. The collaborating team in Vietnam has expertise and experience in urban flood modeling; and they also have access to the necessary data (e.g., roads, drainage infrastructure, rain gauges, and weather forecast). Our project also partners with H/o Chi Minh City Department of Science and Technology. The recommended strategy is once we have developed a pilot app, our partner will convene a demo with city government agencies to get their buy in and input.

You will find the actual webapp tool at `https://floodwatch.netlify.app/`.
